<p>We want to understand why after breast cancer treatment, some women recover faster than others, why their symptoms vary over time and what can be done to make those symptoms improve.   At Institution (nonprofit), we are proposing a new approach for women to monitor their health in real time and to partner in research.<br/><br/>

The “Share the Journey” app will use surveys and phone sensor data to collect and track five common symptoms of breast cancer treatment: fatigue, cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, mood changes and reduction in exercise.  Some participants will also be invited to keep a health diary.<br/><br/>

We hope to learn the differences in symptoms post treatment; to assess whether mobile devices and sensors can help better measure and manage these symptoms and their progression; and to ultimately improve the quality of life for people after breast cancer treatment.<br/>
This study is unique in that it allows participants to step up as equal partners in both the surveillance and management of their symptoms as well as in the research process.
